<description>&lt;p&gt;When all you want is dignity, just a bit of your professional pride left at the end of the bruising, does that sound like too much to ask? When you risk concussions or torn limbs, when every play sounds, up close, like a small car accident, you ought to be left with something more than blooper reel misplays, the ugliest punt snap in football history, dropped passes, one last fumble ripped away and blunders by the officials and even the guys holding the down markers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/for-the-redskins-loss-to-giants-is-another-night-to-forget-in-a-season-full-of-them/2013/12/02/2f274b2c-5b0b-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html?wprss=rss_sports"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/345086f9/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Ffor-the-redskins-loss-to-giants-is-another-night-to-forget-in-a-season-full-of-them%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F2f274b2c-5b0b-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Boswell%3A+For+the+Redskins%2C+loss+to+Giants+is+another+night+to+forget+in+a+season+full+of+them" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Ffor-the-redskins-loss-to-giants-is-another-night-to-forget-in-a-season-full-of-them%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F2f274b2c-5b0b-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Boswell%3A+For+the+Redskins%2C+loss+to+Giants+is+another+night+to+forget+in+a+season+full+of+them" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Ffor-the-redskins-loss-to-giants-is-another-night-to-forget-in-a-season-full-of-them%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F2f274b2c-5b0b-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Boswell%3A+For+the+Redskins%2C+loss+to+Giants+is+another+night+to+forget+in+a+season+full+of+them" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Ffor-the-redskins-loss-to-giants-is-another-night-to-forget-in-a-season-full-of-them%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F2f274b2c-5b0b-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Boswell%3A+For+the+Redskins%2C+loss+to+Giants+is+another+night+to+forget+in+a+season+full+of+them" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Ffor-the-redskins-loss-to-giants-is-another-night-to-forget-in-a-season-full-of-them%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F2f274b2c-5b0b-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Boswell%3A+For+the+Redskins%2C+loss+to+Giants+is+another+night+to+forget+in+a+season+full+of+them" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/180264957745/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f9/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

For the Redskins, loss to Giants is another night to forget in a season full of them
Video: The Washington Post's Mike Jones analyzes what's in store for the Redskins when they take on the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.
By Thomas Boswell , E-mail the writer
When all you want is dignity, just a bit of your professional pride left at the end of the bruising, does that sound like too much to ask? When you risk concussions or torn limbs, when every play sounds, up close, like a small car accident, you ought to be left with something more than blooper reel misplays, the ugliest punt snap in football history, dropped passes, one last fumble ripped away and blunders by the officials and even the guys holding the down markers.
But fair, at least in the sense of merciful, is not how it’s going to be for the Washington Redskins this season. This year is going to be about humiliation, expectations shredded and the best intentions torn to pieces and thrown in your face to see how you’ll react. Six days after they were “embarrassed” in a Monday night game by San Francisco, the Redskins embarrassed themselves on Sunday night, losing 24-17 to the mundane New York Giants . For almost three quarters, they resembled a normal football team. Then, leading 17-14 with 1 minute 5 seconds left in the period, the play that ought to be this season’s ugly emblem rose up to make the Redskins a national chucklefest once again, the providers of an internet laugh-loop that you replay until you cry. Tears of laughter, tears of rage; take your pick.

With a tailored game plan, Robert Griffin III passes efficiently and runs well, yet his teammates let him down.

Washington’s strong start against the Giants is undone by a mountain of penalties, drops and turnovers.
Complete coverage
We can discuss, at our leisure, whether center Kyle Nelson’s hideous snap bounced and dribbled, plopped and piddled, four, five, six or 300 times before it finally reached amazed punter Sav Rocca. We can marvel that Rocca, faced with a worm-burner, could mix sports, field the grounder and still boot the ball side-saddle, like an old-time quick-kicker for an actual 18-yard punt.
We can while away the winter, all those weeks in January and February when the Redskins won’t be playing any football, wondering why Nelson was also called for holding on the play. Perhaps he just wanted to preoccupy one person in FedEx Field from watching that horrible ball bouncing — a snap like no other that he, or perhaps anyone, had ever seen in professional football. What more harm could a 10-yard penalty do, balanced against all the national-TV misery and mockery befalling Washington?
What’s beyond debate is that it’s a play — in its harsh humor, its almost malicious edge — that captures how a team that went 10-6 one season can now be 3-9 and can’t honestly be sure if it will win again this season.
The New York Football Giants, once they stopped their New York Football Laughter, accepted the short punt, and the penalty, then drove 46 yards in 88 seconds to take a 21-17 fourth-quarter lead in this NFC East Pride or Putrid Bowl.
“No, no, no,” said Nelson, when asked whether he had ever perpetrated or seen a snap like that. “It was a shock to me, too.” If everyone were as accountable for everything as Nelson was for that goofy snap, on which he essentially double-hitched, thinking he heard something that wasn’t there, it’d be quite a nice world within minutes.
“It was a missed communication,” he said repeatedly, a non-explanation that can be forgiven. “If I hear something, then stop [the snap motion], just take the penalty,” he said.
