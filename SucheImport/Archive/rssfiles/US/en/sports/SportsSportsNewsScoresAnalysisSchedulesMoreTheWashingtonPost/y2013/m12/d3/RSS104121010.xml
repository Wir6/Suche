<description>&lt;p&gt;Urban Meyer is a superb football coach. His record speaks for itself. In 14 seasons at four different schools he is 128-23. He went undefeated and won a BCS bowl game while at Utah. He won two national championships in six seasons at Florida and is 24-0 since taking over at Ohio State. At just 49 years old, he’s a lock Hall of Famer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/urban-meyer-teaches-marcus-hall-and-his-teammates-the-wrong-lesson/2013/12/03/4374918a-5c22-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html?wprss=rss_sports"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fcolleges%2Furban-meyer-teaches-marcus-hall-and-his-teammates-the-wrong-lesson%2F2013%2F12%2F03%2F4374918a-5c22-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Feinstein%3A+Urban+Meyer+teaches+Marcus+Hall+and+his+teammates+the+wrong+lesson" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fcolleges%2Furban-meyer-teaches-marcus-hall-and-his-teammates-the-wrong-lesson%2F2013%2F12%2F03%2F4374918a-5c22-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Feinstein%3A+Urban+Meyer+teaches+Marcus+Hall+and+his+teammates+the+wrong+lesson" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fcolleges%2Furban-meyer-teaches-marcus-hall-and-his-teammates-the-wrong-lesson%2F2013%2F12%2F03%2F4374918a-5c22-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Feinstein%3A+Urban+Meyer+teaches+Marcus+Hall+and+his+teammates+the+wrong+lesson" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fcolleges%2Furban-meyer-teaches-marcus-hall-and-his-teammates-the-wrong-lesson%2F2013%2F12%2F03%2F4374918a-5c22-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Feinstein%3A+Urban+Meyer+teaches+Marcus+Hall+and+his+teammates+the+wrong+lesson" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fcolleges%2Furban-meyer-teaches-marcus-hall-and-his-teammates-the-wrong-lesson%2F2013%2F12%2F03%2F4374918a-5c22-11e3-95c2-13623eb2b0e1_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Feinstein%3A+Urban+Meyer+teaches+Marcus+Hall+and+his+teammates+the+wrong+lesson" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/180265049979/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345ff8ca/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

Urban Meyer teaches Marcus Hall and his teammates the wrong lesson
Tony Ding/Associated Press - Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer, second from right, stands with his son Nathan, right, and his players in singing the school song after Saturday’s victory at Michigan.
By John Feinstein , E-mail the writer
Urban Meyer is a superb football coach. His record speaks for itself. In 14 seasons at four different schools he is 128-23. He went undefeated and won a BCS bowl game while at Utah. He won two national championships in six seasons at Florida and is 24-0 since taking over at Ohio State. At just 49 years old, he’s a lock Hall of Famer.
He is also everything that is wrong with college athletics today.
Friday's Photos of the day
It isn’t just that Meyer is about winning and winning only. That doesn’t make him any different than 99 percent of the coaches who are paid millions of dollars to win at the big-time level in football and basketball.
What separates Meyer from most of his colleagues is his ability to sell the notion that he’s clean when there’s dirt and mud all over him. If you bring up all the Florida players who were arrested during his time in Gainesville, his defenders will howl at the unfairness of it all. Some charges were dropped, and some of the charges were relatively minor. That’s what the Meyer-backers claim constantly.
Meyer is very good at altering the story line for his convenience. When he became a hot coach at Utah, he said repeatedly that Notre Dame had always been his dream job. Then he turned down Notre Dame to go to Florida because the salary was higher and the admissions standards for football players lower.
In 2009, he retired as Florida’s coach for health reasons. About 15 minutes later, he un-retired. Less than a year later, he quit again, saying it was time to spend more time with his family. That didn’t last long. After one season as a talking head on ESPN, he was back in coaching at Ohio State.
The most dangerous con-men are the ones who are the best at what they do. Former Maryland basketball coach Gary Williams once described one of his peers as, “the most dangerous man in college basketball today.”
Why was he so dangerous?
“Because he’s a good guy, a fun guy to be around, he’s really smart, he’s charming and he’s a hell of a coach,” Williams said. “And he’s a complete crook.”
Meyer’s not a crook, but he’s about as smarmy as they come.
The latest evidence came this past weekend after his team escaped with a 42-41 victory over a mediocre Michigan team to finish the regular season 12-0. The Buckeyes now play Michigan State for the Big Ten title on Saturday.
And starting guard Marcus Hall will be on the field. He will be on the field even though he completely disgraced Ohio State on Saturday. Hall was one of three players ejected in the wake of a first-half fight . After getting tossed, Hall went berserk — kicking things, throwing his helmet and, on his way out, giving the Michigan fans a double one-fingered salute that was captured for national television and posterity.
After the game when Meyer was asked about Hall’s behavior his answer was direct: “I’m disappointed,” he said. “I’ll take care of it.”
Sunday, he did just that, announcing that Hall would play against Michigan State. His rationale was that both Hall and wide receiver Dontre Wilson had “lost a game” by being ejected and NCAA rules say that an ejection for fighting means a one-game suspension. If the fight had been in the second half, the two players would have had to sit out the first half Saturday.
