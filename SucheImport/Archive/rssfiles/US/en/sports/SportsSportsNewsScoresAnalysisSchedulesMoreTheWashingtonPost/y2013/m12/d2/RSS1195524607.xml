<description>&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/football-insider/wp/2013/12/02/game-ends-with-confusion-controversy-over-what-down-it-was/"&gt; “which down is it anyway?” ballyhoo &lt;/a&gt;at the end of Sunday night’s loss to the Giants will give Washington something about which to natter — like Twitter, but with your mouth — for the week, but while it was vaguely ridiculous, it wasn’t season-threatening. No, the threat this season has been the team itself, which has had so many “vaguely ridiculous” experiences that they should be part of a special promotion from Papa John’s: “Wrong down marker leads to incorrect play call? Get a free liter of Coke with any medium pizza!” After all, those “extra toppings for touchdowns” promotions aren’t exactly breaking the bank.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/redskins-giants-game-the-latest-act-in-season-long-theater-of-the-absurd/2013/12/02/210fb7f2-5b62-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html?wprss=rss_sports"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/34566faf/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-giants-game-the-latest-act-in-season-long-theater-of-the-absurd%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F210fb7f2-5b62-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Hamilton%3A+Redskins-Giants+game+the+latest+act+in+season-long+theater+of+the+absurd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-giants-game-the-latest-act-in-season-long-theater-of-the-absurd%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F210fb7f2-5b62-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Hamilton%3A+Redskins-Giants+game+the+latest+act+in+season-long+theater+of+the+absurd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-giants-game-the-latest-act-in-season-long-theater-of-the-absurd%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F210fb7f2-5b62-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Hamilton%3A+Redskins-Giants+game+the+latest+act+in+season-long+theater+of+the+absurd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-giants-game-the-latest-act-in-season-long-theater-of-the-absurd%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F210fb7f2-5b62-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Hamilton%3A+Redskins-Giants+game+the+latest+act+in+season-long+theater+of+the+absurd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-giants-game-the-latest-act-in-season-long-theater-of-the-absurd%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F210fb7f2-5b62-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Hamilton%3A+Redskins-Giants+game+the+latest+act+in+season-long+theater+of+the+absurd" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

<ExtractedText>It wasn’t fun even while it lasted
Tracee Hamilton
Sunday night’s game was the latest act in a season-long theater of the absurd for the Washington Redskins.
Mike Jones
The Redskins no longer have postseason hopes, but the coach says he'll still play the best players.
Shanahan-Griffin: An unmendable tear?
Mike Wise
In trying to show loyalty to his franchise QB 11 months ago, coach made decision that still reverberates.
Redskins vs. Giants: Early lead, late chances slip away
Mark Maske
Washington lost 24-17, falling to 3-9 despite an early 14-0 lead and a good game from Robert Griffin III.
Griffin not a problem this time
Kent Babb
With a tailored game plan, Robert Griffin III passes efficiently and runs well, yet his teammates let him down.
Mike Jones
Washington’s strong start against the Giants is undone by a mountain of penalties, drops and turnovers.
But this was a 3-8 team vs. a 4-7 team, after all. And that 3-8 team was Washington. Which meant a defensive breakdown, a special teams breakdown and some just plain breakdowns were on their way .
Remember the team that used to commit penalties in bundles, like they were part of a cable package? That team came back from the holidays rarin’ to go, with eight for 55 yards. And it wasn’t just quantity but quality: Santana Moss committed a holding penalty followed by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Long snapper Kyle Nelson capped a bad snap on a punt with a holding penalty, like a rotten cherry on top of a rancid sundae. Pierre Garcon showed his displeasure at a low throw from Griffin — or at Griffin himself — by kicking the ball into the stands for a delay of game. (Meanwhile, Ben Olsen immediately called Garcon’s agent.)
Garcon has had reason to be cranky at times this season , but Sunday wasn’t one of those times. He dropped some very catchable balls, and he drew that stupid penalty, and he had a look of barely contained anger for much of the game, and he was stripped of the ball at the end. Forget coaching — it might be time for some marriage counseling because this team needs both him and Griffin, and while they don’t have to play nice, it is crucial that they play well. Garcon, on Sunday, did not.
Griffin, on Sunday, did. There has been much talk about benching Griffin for the remainder of the season to protect his knee and give Kirk Cousins some playing time. There is a lot of logic to that plan. NBC stirred the pot by giving us a shot of Cousins on the sideline, wearing one of those cold-weather capes. There is no more attractive man in Washington from September to January than the backup quarterback — not even if Daniel Snyder were to invite Ryan Gosling, Denzel Washington and Adam Levine to the owner’s box for a game. (The Squire could have pulled off that trifecta.)
