<description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins"&gt;Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt;’ embarrassing late-season slide continued Sunday night in a &lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/fb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=20131201028&amp;#38;home=&amp;#38;vis=&amp;#38;meta=true"&gt;24-17 loss &lt;/a&gt;to the &lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/fb/teamstats.asp?team=19"&gt;New York Giants&lt;/a&gt;. In losing their fourth consecutive game, they squandered a 14-0 second-quarter lead, displayed an alarming lack of discipline, wasted an encouraging performance by Robert Griffin III and flopped again on special teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/redskins-vs-giants-washingtons-late-season-slide-continues-in-24-17-loss/2013/12/02/0888704e-5b07-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html?wprss=rss_sports"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/345086f3/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-vs-giants-washingtons-late-season-slide-continues-in-24-17-loss%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F0888704e-5b07-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Reid%3A+Redskins+vs.+Giants%3A+Washington%E2%80%99s+late-season+slide+continues+in+24-17+loss" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-vs-giants-washingtons-late-season-slide-continues-in-24-17-loss%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F0888704e-5b07-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Reid%3A+Redskins+vs.+Giants%3A+Washington%E2%80%99s+late-season+slide+continues+in+24-17+loss" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-vs-giants-washingtons-late-season-slide-continues-in-24-17-loss%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F0888704e-5b07-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Reid%3A+Redskins+vs.+Giants%3A+Washington%E2%80%99s+late-season+slide+continues+in+24-17+loss" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-vs-giants-washingtons-late-season-slide-continues-in-24-17-loss%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F0888704e-5b07-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Reid%3A+Redskins+vs.+Giants%3A+Washington%E2%80%99s+late-season+slide+continues+in+24-17+loss" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Fredskins%2Fredskins-vs-giants-washingtons-late-season-slide-continues-in-24-17-loss%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F0888704e-5b07-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Reid%3A+Redskins+vs.+Giants%3A+Washington%E2%80%99s+late-season+slide+continues+in+24-17+loss" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/180264957744/u/89/f/636679/c/34656/s/345086f3/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

<ExtractedText>It wasn’t fun even while it lasted
Tracee Hamilton
Sunday night’s game was the latest act in a season-long theater of the absurd for the Washington Redskins.
Mike Jones
The Redskins no longer have postseason hopes, but the coach says he'll still play the best players.
Shanahan-Griffin: An unmendable tear?
Mike Wise
In trying to show loyalty to his franchise QB 11 months ago, coach made decision that still reverberates.
Redskins vs. Giants: Early lead, late chances slip away
Mark Maske
Washington lost 24-17, falling to 3-9 despite an early 14-0 lead and a good game from Robert Griffin III.
Griffin not a problem this time
Kent Babb
With a tailored game plan, Robert Griffin III passes efficiently and runs well, yet his teammates let him down.
Mike Jones
Washington’s strong start against the Giants is undone by a mountain of penalties, drops and turnovers.
Washington’s botched snap on a late-game punt — and the snapper’s ensuing penalty on the play — were among many second-half lowlights for the reeling Redskins. They dropped to 3-9 and were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.
The game was settled on a special teams lapse. Let’s start there.
Not very special teams
Special teams have hurt the Redskins all season — and it was no different Sunday night.
The Redskins led 17-14 with about a minute remaining in the third quarter. On fourth and 17 from their 38-yard line, the Redskins lined up to punt. Long snapper Kyle Nelson essentially rolled the ball to punter Sav Rocca, who did a great job just to recover the ball and get off a kick, which covered only 18 yards.
As if Nelson’s botched snap wasn’t bad enough, he also was called for holding on the play. Four plays later, Andre Brown scored on a one-yard run to cap the Giants’ four-play, 46-yard drive for the go-ahead score.
In the 32-team NFL, the Redskins rank 30th in punt return yardage, 31st on kickoff returns and last in punt return coverage. The pratfall performance on the punt Sunday further illustrated why major change is needed on special teams.
Griffin’s passing grade
Considering how much Griffin has struggled this season, the Redskins should be encouraged about his performance.
Griffin completed his first 12 passes . He teamed with tight end Logan Paulsen on a 19-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter and for the game completed passes to eight receivers.
For a quarterback who often has appeared lost in the pocket this season, Griffin showed progress, especially in throwing shorter passes — check downs — when receivers were covered downfield.
Of course, as we’ve come to learn, Griffin is far from being a polished pocket passer. He must improve at seeing the whole field. Twice early in the game, wide receiver Aldrick Robinson was open deep in the defensive backfield. Griffin missed the opportunity and threw short passes instead. Griffin still holds the ball too long. He has to get rid of it quicker.
In many ways, Griffin’s outing against the Giants was a step forward. For the Redskins to get to where they hope to go, Griffin has to keep making them.
Davis sighting
It was only a 12-yard reception during the opening drive. Fred Davis has made bigger contributions. But the catch was Davis’s first since Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers. Finally, Davis did something to help.
After five straight games being inactive, Davis returned to the lineup in last week’s 27-6 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Although Davis had no receptions and played sparingly in place of sidelined rookie tight end Jordan Reed, he showed signs of life against the Giants in a two-catch, 13-yard performance.
