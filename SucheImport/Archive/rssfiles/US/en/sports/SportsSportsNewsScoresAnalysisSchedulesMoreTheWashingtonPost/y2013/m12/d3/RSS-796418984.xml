With Manny Parra heading back to Cincinnati, the Nationals missed another potential upgrade to their left-handed relief
Mike DeBonis and James Wagner
After spending more than $600 million on the baseball stadium, Mayor Gray said no to the request.
Nationals Journal
Insight on the Nationals and all the latest news from Post reporters Adam Kilgore and James Wagner.
With a groundball-heavy style, the 6-foot-8 right-hander has become one of the league’s most reliable starters. Fister went 14-9 with a 3.67 ERA in 2082 / 3 innings for the American League Central champion Tigers last season. Over the past four seasons, all in the AL, Fister has a 3.48 ERA.
“This is an exciting day for the Washington Nationals,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said in a press release. “We feel we’ve added a talented, young veteran to our starting pitching corps. Doug is battle-tested through playoff experiences, and the depth he brings to our staff is exceptional. We are thrilled to welcome him aboard.”
In recent seasons, the Nationals had backed their top three starters — Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez and Jordan Zimmermann — with expensive, one-year free agent signings. They added Edwin Jackson for 2012 and Dan Haren for 2013 at $11 million and $13 million. Fister will be owed roughly $7 million through a raise in arbitration, and the Nationals have a right-hander who will be eligible for arbitration again for the 2015 season.
The cost to acquire him appeared light to some across the sport, even those who did not want to bet against savvy Detroit General Manager Dave Dombrowski. “Rizzo didn’t give up any major pieces for a legit number three” starter, one NL scout said.
Lombardozzi, an Atholton High grad who still lived in his home town of Columbia, had become a beloved teammate and a fan favorite for his hustle and intelligence. As a freshman at Atholton, his coach played him on the grass for fear he could not make the throw across the infield. Now he’s a big leaguer, entrenched as a steady pinch hitter. But he also had a .264 batting average, a .297 on-base percentage and .342 slugging average over his first three seasons, a span of 257 games.
Krol arrived with the Nationals last winter as part of the trade that sent Michael Morse to Seattle. At 22, he helped stabilize the bullpen upon his call-up in early June, but his high-90s fastball became more suspect as the season wore on. He finished his rookie season with a 3.95 ERA over 271 / 3 innings. Without Krol, the Nationals will be pressed to add a left-handed reliever. Already, they have contacted numerous free agents.
The best player of the trio may ultimately turn out to be Ray, a 22-year-old lefty who reached Class AA Harrisburg this season. The Nationals gave Ray a $799,000 signing bonus in 2010, which at the time made him the second player drafted after the fourth round to be given a bonus that large. Ray went 11-5 with a 3.36 ERA this year. Baseball America ranked Ray as the Nationals’ No. 5 prospect behind pitchers A.J. Cole and top prospect Lucas Giolito.
