<title>Bode Miller commands attention in run-up to Sochi — win, lose or crash</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Sidelined by knee surgery and largely out of the spotlight for 18 months, Bode Miller was no less brash on the eve of his return to competition this fall. Asked his expectations as he girded for a run at his fifth Winter Olympics, the 36-year-old Miller said: “The plan is to kick [butt].”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/bode-miller-commands-attention-in-run-up-to-sochi--win-lose-or-crash/2013/12/02/9fb14234-5b84-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html?wprss=rss_sports"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636679/s/34586dac/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Folympics%2Fbode-miller-commands-attention-in-run-up-to-sochi--win-lose-or-crash%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F9fb14234-5b84-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Bode+Miller+commands+attention+in+run-up+to+Sochi+%E2%80%94+win%2C+lose+or+crash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Folympics%2Fbode-miller-commands-attention-in-run-up-to-sochi--win-lose-or-crash%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F9fb14234-5b84-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Bode+Miller+commands+attention+in+run-up+to+Sochi+%E2%80%94+win%2C+lose+or+crash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Folympics%2Fbode-miller-commands-attention-in-run-up-to-sochi--win-lose-or-crash%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F9fb14234-5b84-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Bode+Miller+commands+attention+in+run-up+to+Sochi+%E2%80%94+win%2C+lose+or+crash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Folympics%2Fbode-miller-commands-attention-in-run-up-to-sochi--win-lose-or-crash%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F9fb14234-5b84-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Bode+Miller+commands+attention+in+run-up+to+Sochi+%E2%80%94+win%2C+lose+or+crash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fsports%2Folympics%2Fbode-miller-commands-attention-in-run-up-to-sochi--win-lose-or-crash%2F2013%2F12%2F02%2F9fb14234-5b84-11e3-a66d-156b463c78aa_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_sports&amp;t=Bode+Miller+commands+attention+in+run-up+to+Sochi+%E2%80%94+win%2C+lose+or+crash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

But if ever there were a skier who demands attention regardless of how calamitous his previous performance, it is Miller, a preternaturally gifted athlete whose competitive DNA defies convention and common sense.
Win, crash or finish hopelessly in arrears, Miller is thrilling to watch — whether hurtling full-tilt down an icy course on a second giant-slalom run to vault from seventh to a silver medal, as he did at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics; or racing on one leg, as he did at Bormio, Italy, in 2005 upon losing a ski 16 seconds into the combined until gravity sent him into a slide.
At the same time, Miller can be difficult to cheer, as many found during the 2006 Turin Olympics, where he completed just two of his five events, failed to win a single medal yet declared his Games a success because he had partied “at an Olympic level.” As a consequence the United States’ most decorated Olympic skier is more beloved in Europe than at home.
Eight years later, he’s seeking a spot on the Sochi-bound U.S.  ski team not to win hearts or medals — indifferent to the spoils of his triumphs, he recently tweeted a photograph of a batch of chicken wings marinating in one of his trophies — but because he believes he can still be competitive despite a surgically repaired left knee.
“I’ve made plenty of mistakes; I’ve done tons of stupid things. I’ve had plenty of awful races, and I’ve had a bunch of really amazing races,” Miller said during an interview with U.S. Olympic reporters this fall. “I wouldn’t change anything.”
Reared in a New Hampshire cabin without electricity or running water, Miller started skiing competitively at age 11, made his World Cup debut at 20 and long ago passed the point at which most professional skiers would have retired. He has won two overall World Cup championships (in 2005 and 2008), 33 World Cup races and five Olympic medals (two silvers at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games and a gold, silver and bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Games ).
And for a nearly four-year stretch, he held the record for most consecutive World Cup starts (136) — a testament to his versatility, competing in all five disciplines, and all the more impressive given the unchained fury with which he attacks his races.
But after undergoing microsurgery on his left knee in spring 2012, Miller announced he would skip the 2013 World Cup season to fully heal in time for one final Olympics before retiring.
In many respects, he has returned a changed man: leaner most notably, having shed 20 pounds to get down to his current 205.
