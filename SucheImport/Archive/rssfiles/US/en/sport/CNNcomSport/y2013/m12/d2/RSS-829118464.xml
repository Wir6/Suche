<ExtractedText>Police investigate suspicious death at Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium
From Dave Alsup, CNN
December 2, 2013 -- Updated 1251 GMT (2051 HKT)
The suspicious death outside Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday did not involve any kind of "fan rivalry," police said.
(CNN) -- Police are investigating the death of a man Sunday at the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium after he got into a struggle with another person.
The incident occurred in a parking lot at the stadium while the Chiefs played the Denver Broncos just inside the venue, Kansas City, Missouri, police spokesman Tye Grant said.
The altercation began when someone left the game and found the man, who later died at an area hospital, inside their car. The man may have owned a similar car, Grant said.
"The incident did not involve any fan rivalry," Police Chief Darryl Forte said in a Twitter post.
Three people are in police custody, Grant said.
