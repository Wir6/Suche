Israel denied the accusation
Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A senior Hezbollah commander was killed outside his home in Beirut early Wednesday, a Lebanese security official told CNN.
Hassan Al-Laqees was shot four times, "In the head and in the shoulder," the source said.
The source added that a silenced pistol was probably used and there were "maybe" two or three attackers.
Hezbollah said Laqees was "assassinated" in the southern district of Hadath as he was returning home from work.
The militant Shiite group blamed Israel for the killing -- but Israel denied it.
'"This is strictly nothing to do with Israel," Yigal Palmor, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
Hezbollah said Laqees had been a member of the group since its formation.
